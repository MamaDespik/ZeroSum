10 wins a lot, seemingly because they can easily lose 10 in the first round.
Max you could gain in 1st round is 6, and then you've got one less person trying to lose, so it's harder to gain
a more even goal numbering might be better (0,1,2,3,4,5,6)

dumb AI is good enough, time to move on to allowing a human Player.  
[done] At some point I may want to archive code, then do a big cleanup.  Things have gotten messy over the past few days.
Current Road Map:  	
	Single Player ability
	Multi Player ability
	dumb AI play improvement
		instead of basing purchases off of starting gold, base off of current + estimated from purchases
	dumb AI guessing
	Neural Network Framework
	Mid-level NN AI (train against dumb)
		should I do one brain for each goal, or a single brain?
	Advanced-level NNAI (train against mid->self)
		same question as above
		
Single Player Sprint
	[done]Cleanup
		[done] There's multiple "checkGoal" functions across the classes.  Can these be combined?
		[done] Make a set function for player coins (specifically so AI players can keep track of round-starting gold)
			[todo]should this be done for more (all?) properties?
		[moved to GitHub] Disposing/memory management?
	[done] Addition of player in Game Setup
		[done] backfill of computer players
		[done]in game setup, only block until user confirms player addition done, not until list full
		[done] make it event based
	[done]Let player select their action
		[done]After taking first action, player always passes
		[done]Need to display current stock to player
		[done]Need to display goal
		[done]Need to display current coin value to player
		[done]make current combobox the players action at start of takingturn
		[done]clean up displays after game
		[done]Make it event based
	[done]Add pauses to make the game more observable
	[done]Let player make guesses
	[done]instead of multiple "fetching" booleans, maybe just one? [not needed if we move to event based]
	[done]add display of "passed for round" and "passed for game" on each turn
	[moved to GitHub]When you hit new game, the old game is still playing
	[done]keep coin totals up-to-date
	[done]deselect action on hittind OK;
	[done]keep current stock display
		[done]use event
		[done] Bug: displays last share from previous round until new share bought
	[done]display shares that player has bought
		[done] bug: display doesn't update between rounds (never clears out)
	[done]Player Display should update for current player
		[done]Keep AI Coins, Total, and Shares hidden
		[moved to GitHub] current solution will display all human players' info
	[moved to GitHub] display round number using event
	[moved to GitHub] add ability to OK moving to the next turn
	[moved to GitHub] add tracking of simulation (and maybe also if there are any active human players) to speed up computer play
	[moved to GitHub] add and end-round screen to show net change in coins
	[moved to GitHub] Notes Section for tracking guesses
		or allow guessing at any time, then have a confirmation at end of game
	[moved to GitHub] should Game subscribe to child events, the evoke?  AKA, should display really be subscribing to events from things other than game?
