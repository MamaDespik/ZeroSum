One player is chosen to start the round, and play progresses clockwise
share cards are stacked in the center in price order (0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
on their turn, a player can choose to buy the topmost share card for its price, or pass
a player must pass if they can't afford the share
after three players have passed in a row, the round is over
the pot is divided up evenly for each share bought; remainders are distributed to shares in order of purchase
shares are returned to the center, and the next round begins with the player clockwise from the previous round's starter
If the starting player passes on their first turn, the round is over and the next player starts the next round
after three rounds (in a row?) have ended with no coins being exchanged, the game is over
